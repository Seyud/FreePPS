## ✨ Module Overview

FreePPS is a module specifically designed for Xiaomi/Mi devices that can **unlock and enable public PPS (Programmable Power Supply) fast charging protocol support**, giving your device better compatibility!

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: After enabling public PPS support, the device will **automatically disable MIPPS (Xiaomi proprietary PPS protocol) support**. The two protocols conflict and cannot be enabled simultaneously. Please choose the appropriate protocol based on your charging device.
